Our website is a COVID-19 informational page
Authors: Terry Hong, Steven Vu, Tommy Vu

Problems:
    -FIRST time for all of us in terms of HTML and CSS (wanted to learn something new)
    -Drop down menu was a huge pain
        ->Clips with everything (including the background itself)
        ->Caused many resizing issues with other objects in the website
        ->Had to convert almost everything into simple buttons
    -Resizing issues due to different window sizes
    -Ambitious ideas that required javascript and none of us know 
        ->Scratched a lot of ideas
