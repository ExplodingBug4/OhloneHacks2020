# OhloneHacks2020
Our website is a COVID-19 informational page
Authors: Terry Hong, Steven Vu, Tommy Vu

Note: Some pages will have a back-up home button. Just renamed as "Lackadaisical Covid-19".

Problems & Stuggles:
    -FIRST time for all of us in terms of HTML and CSS (wanted to learn something new)
    -Drop down menu was a huge pain
        ->Clips with everything (including the background itself)
        ->Caused many resizing issues with other objects in the website
        ->Had to convert almost everything into simple buttons
    -Resizing issues due to different window sizes
    -Ambitious ideas that required javascript and none of us knows it
        ->Scrapped a lot of ideas
    -Included a picture of our initial design before coding
        ->Scrapped test/game idea due to javascript
    -The "Prepare Yourself" tab was extremely tedious
        ->Getting the cards to actually rotate over was very hard. 
        ->Making lists were also a bit confusing
